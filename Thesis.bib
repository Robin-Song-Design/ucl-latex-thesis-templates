  abstract = {We present Menge, a cross-platform, extensible, modular framework for simulating pedestrian movement in a crowd. Menge's architecture is inspired by an implicit decomposition of the problem of simulating crowds into component subproblems. These subproblems can typically be solved in many ways; different combinations of subproblem solutions yield crowd simulators with likewise varying properties. Menge creates abstractions for those subproblems and provides a plug-in architecture so that a novel simulator can be dynamically configured by connecting built-in and bespoke implementations of solutions to the various subproblems. Use of this type of framework could facilitate crowd simulation research, evaluation, and applications by reducing the cost of entering the domain, facilitating collaboration, and making comparisons between algorithms simpler. We show how the Menge framework is compatible with many prior models and algorithms used in crowd simulation and illustrate its flexibility via a varied set of scenarios and applications.},

@article{ExperimentalObservationsEvacuation,
  title = {Experimental Observations of Evacuation Situations},
  abstract = {In fire safety engineering, the performance based design concept relies strongly on the use of computer simulations of fire and evacuation processes. The validation of the simulation tools requires experimental information on the human behaviour during the evacuation situations. In this work, two different types of evacuation situations were studied. The first type was evacuation drills which are normally carried out as part of the safety training of the staff in public buildings and workplaces. The advantage of evacuation drills is that the building (and, if necessary, also the occupants) can be equipped with monitoring devices in order to observe the events during the evacuation. The drawback of the evacuation drills is that the building occupants are normally informed beforehand which may affect the decision making processes. The second type was actual evacuations which occur every now and then. The advantage of actual evacuations is that the decision making processes are likely to be similar to what they would be in case of a real fire.},

Soft computing approaches play a vital role in the design and deployment of intelligent evacuation applications pertaining to crowd control management. While the review deals with video and nonvideo based aspects of crowd monitoring and crowd disaster prediction, evacuation techniques are reviewed via the theme of soft computing, along with a brief review on the evacuation navigation path.

  abstract = {The duration of the evacuation process in case of emergencies in tall buildings is a crucial issue. Various factors have significant impact on the evacuation time, e.g. stairwell geometry, speed, density, pre-evacuation delay, number of occupants and their familiarity with the building, behavior, age, gender, physical abilities, relationships between people, etc. Although there are many studies on the subject, research results from Bulgaria and comparison with those from other places in the world are not yet available. Also, studies performed by researchers who have pro\- fessional operational firefighting experience are very limited. In this study, two evacuation ex\- periments in a new 107 m tall office building in Bulgaria were designed under the supervision of professional firefighting personnel. The first experiment was conducted to estimate the free movement characteristics under ``normal'' conditions for determining the average duration of the evacuation and the range of the vertical speed. Thirteen participants were instructed to move down from 17F to outside the building, following their normal habits. Their evacuation times differed in the range from 192 s--328 s, while the vertical speed is highest at the upper floors 0.35 m/s and reduce to 0.20 m/s just before the exits. The second experiment was an evacuation drill of 177 people from the floors they work in the building. The evacuation duration of this exper\- iment for all these people from the building was in the range of 2--6 min. The study is also enriched through Pathfinder software simulations for verification of the results, where a good match was observed (6:26 min total evacuation time). Another simulation at the maximum oc\- cupants' capacity of the building with 2195 people was also run (24:48 min for the total evac\- uation time). We believe that the benefits achieved on the differences in the real experimental data from different parts of the world can be valuable for validation of tall building evacuation models. In addition, the link between the evacuation drill findings and the professional fire\- fighting considerations, problems and decision-making operations in case of fire is discussed.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian dynamics is an interdisciplinary field of research. Psychologists, sociologists, traffic engineers, physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists all strive to understand the dynamics of a moving crowd. In principle, computer simulations offer means to further this understanding. Yet, unlike for many classic dynamical systems in physics, there is no universally accepted locomotion model for crowd dynamics. On the contrary, a multitude of approaches, with very different characteristics, compete. Often only the experts in one special model type are able to assess the consequences these characteristics have on a simulation study. Therefore, scientists from all disciplines who wish to use simulations to analyze pedestrian dynamics need a tool to compare competing approaches. Developers, too, would profit from an easy way to get insight into an alternative modeling ansatz. Vadere meets this interdisciplinary demand by offering an open-source simulation framework that is lightweight in its approach and in its user interface while offering pre-implemented versions of the most widely spread models.},

  abstract = {Gate machines, such as ticket gates in stations and secure gates in office buildings, are very common in people's daily lives. On the one hand, the passage between the gates is not wide enough for pedestrians to pass through, which may affect the traffic efficiency of the crowd; on the other hand, the gates make pedestrians move more orderly and smooth and may speed up evacuation. Whether the gates benefit or hinder the movement and evacuation of a crowd is not clear for now. This paper studies the effects of gate machines on crowd traffic based on simulations using the modified social force model. Three simulation scenarios are considered, including the absence of any gate machines, the presence of gate machines without invisible walls, and the presence of gate machines with invisible walls. Normal and evacuation situations are distinguished by whether or not a pedestrian pauses for a while in front of the gates. The influences of factors such as the number of passages, exit width, and the number of pedestrians on crowd traffic are analyzed. Simulation results show that for different exit widths, there is a corresponding optimal number of passages to make the evacuation efficiency of the crowd the highest. The conclusions of this paper can provide some suggestions for the setting of the gate machines and the development of evacuation strategies.},

The classrooms used in the simulations were modelled after real classrooms at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The different configurations were one exit, two exits, three exits, one exit on the back wall, and a double door on the back wall. These were chosen since previous research have focused on similar layouts.},

  abstract = {This paper works on one of the most recent pedestrian crowd evacuation models---i.e., ``a simulation model for pedestrian crowd evacuation based on various AI techniques''---which was developed in late 2019. This study adds a new feature to the developed model by proposing a new method and integrating it into the model. This method enables the developed model to find a more appropriate evacuation area design regarding safety due to selecting the best exit door location among many suggested locations. This method is completely dependent on the selected model's output---i.e., the evacuation time for each individual within the evacuation process. The new method finds an average of the evacuees' evacuation times of each exit door location; then, based on the average evacuation time, it decides which exit door location would be the best exit door to be used for evacuation by the evacuees. To validate the method, various designs for the evacuation area with various written scenarios were used. The results showed that the model with this new method could predict a proper exit door location among many suggested locations. Lastly, from the results of this research using the integration of this newly proposed method, a new capability for the selected model in terms of safety allowed the right decision in selecting the finest design for the evacuation area among other designs.},

  abstract = {A review of literature related to fire evacuation in high-rise buildings was carried out with the following objectives, (1) to identify the key behavioural factors affecting the performance of people during a fire in a high-rise building, the singularities associated to this type of buildings and areas of future research; (2) to review the procedures and strategies currently adopted in high-rise buildings; (3) to review and analyse the capabilities of evacuation models by reviewing their current characteristics and applications in the context of high-rise building evacuations. The review included both findings on human behaviour in high-rise buildings and modelling techniques and tools. Different categories of building use were taken into account, namely office buildings, residential buildings and health care facilities. The individual or combined use of different egress components was analysed. Egress components include the use of stairs, elevators as well as alternative means of escape (e.g., sky-bridges, helicopters, etc.). The effectiveness of the egress components is strongly affected by the building use and the population involved. The review shows that evacuation models can be effectively employed to study relocation strategies and safety issues associated with high-rise buildings. The suitability of egress models for high-rise building evacuations is associated with their flexibility in representing different egress components and complex behavioural processes. The review highlights that there is not a definitive model to be used but that the predictive capabilities of evacuation modelling techniques would be enhanced if more than one model is employed to study different egress aspects. Future research and model developments should focus on the study of the impact of staff actions, group dynamics and people with disabilities. Given the increasing height of buildings and the gradual reduction in the physical abilities of the population, the effects of fatigue on evacuation need further studies.},
