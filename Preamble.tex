\begin{abstract} % 300 word limit

This study systematically investigates how internal spatial configurations in office spaces — specifically desk layout, corridor width, number of exits, and door width — influence the efficiency of orderly evacuation under fixed building constraints. We conduct multi-scale agent-based simulations within a coupled Rhino 9 with Grasshopper and JuPedSim workflow, constructing two prototypes (Small and Big) and comparing island layouts (A, B, C), various corridor/door width combinations, and single vs. double exits. Preliminary trajectory data are used to derive metrics such as speed, path length, Total Evacuation Time (TET), and congestion hotspots. Results indicate that internal layout significantly affects congestion hotspots and path choices, with door-corridor width coupling showing threshold effects and scale dependence, especially in the Big prototype. Temporal/spatial patterns are analyzed via heat maps, density distributions, and time-series analysis; robustness is evaluated via repeated simulations. Data are stored in SQLite databases with metadata to ensure reproducibility.

% \begin{impactstatement}

%     UCL theses now have to include an impact statement. \textit{(I think for REF reasons?)} The following text is the description from the guide linked from the formatting and submission website of what that involves. (Link to the guide: {\scriptsize \url{http://www.grad.ucl.ac.uk/essinfo/docs/Impact-Statement-Guidance-Notes-for-Research-Students-and-Supervisors.pdf}})

%     \begin{quote}
%         The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis,
%         discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits both
%         inside and outside academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

%         The benefits inside academia could be to the discipline and future scholarship, research methods or
%         methodology, the curriculum; they might be within your research area and potentially within other
%         research areas.

%         The benefits outside academia could occur to commercial activity, social enterprise, professional
%         practice, clinical use, public health, public policy design, public service delivery, laws, public
%         discourse, culture, the quality of the environment or quality of life.

%         The impact could occur locally, regionally, nationally or internationally, to individuals, communities or
%         organisations and could be immediate or occur incrementally, in the context of a broader field of
%         research, over many years, decades or longer.

%         Impact could be brought about through disseminating outputs (either in scholarly journals or
%         elsewhere such as specialist or mainstream media), education, public engagement, translational
%         research, commercial and social enterprise activity, engaging with public policy makers and public
%         service delivery practitioners, influencing ministers, collaborating with academics and non-academics
%         etc.

%         Further information including a searchable list of hundreds of examples of UCL impact outside of
%         academia please see \url{https://www.ucl.ac.uk/impact/}. For thousands more examples, please see
%         \url{http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/SelectUoa}.
