    \label{fig:tet_vs_width}
\end{figure}
The results of this study \ref{fig:tet_vs_width} indicate that the wider the corridor, the shorter the total evacuation time, but the returns from widening do not increase linearly. Within the range of approximately 1.0-1.6/1.8 m, even a slight increase in width can lead to a significant reduction in time; when the width approaches or exceeds 2.0 m, continued widening still provides benefits, but the magnitude is no longer substantial. This aligns with everyday experience: in very crowded spaces, even a small additional passageway can help disperse the flow of people; however, when the space is not particularly crowded to begin with, adding more passageway does not yield such noticeable improvement.

\subsection{Speed and Trajectories Analysis}
Looking at the speed and trajectories of Layout A,B,C \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_A}\ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_B}\ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_C}, as the width increased from 1.0m to 1.6-1.8m, the main corridors of the three layouts generally transformed from a crowded zone to two relatively stable parallel lanes. The speed chart shows that the originally continuous red and yellow bands have been replaced by two greener bands, and the slow zone has significantly contracted. This indicates that the increase in width first reduces lateral friction and frequent evasive maneuvering, allowing individuals to maintain a speed close to free-flow for a longer period of time. In terms of the total evacuation time, this stage has the largest reduction, and the result fluctuations of each layout have simultaneously decreased.
\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{speed_trajectory_layout_A.png}
    \caption{Speed and Trajectories for Layout A}
    \label{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_A}
\end{figure}
The main corridor in Layout A is relatively straight, with multiple tributary inflow points along the line. The trajectory and velocity diagrams show that tributaries have already formed orderly queues before reaching the confluence point, with only mild short-distance deceleration when entering the main corridor. This suggests that conflicts are resolved in advance within the tributaries, with stable dual lanes forming starting from corridor widths of 1.6 m, while widths of 2.0-2.4 m maintain only small deceleration zones before the final exit. As a result, medium to high-width sections have lower average times, smaller variances, and higher speed limits. Furthermore, as width increases, evacuation time decreases relatively steadily.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{speed_trajectory_layout_B.png}
    \caption{Speed and Trajectories for Layout B}
    \label{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_B}
\end{figure}
Layout B contains multiple T-shaped or cross intersections with dispersed confluence points. Under corridor widths of 1.0-1.4 m, the lower section near intersection points repeatedly experiences team breaking and regrouping phenomena. The visual manifestation in the diagram is the formation of multiple mesh-like low-speed zones, with numerous congestion points covering a wide range. After widening the width to 1.6 and 1.8 m, these mesh-like low-speed zones significantly diminish and form lanes, which indicates that widening the corridor width can effectively avoid interactive conflicts, resulting in the greatest time reduction. However, at 2.4 m, some remaining light yellow zones are still visible, causing the speed limitation at the high-width stage to be slightly lower than layouts A and C.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{speed_trajectory_layout_C.png}
    \caption{Speed and Trajectories for Layout C}
    \label{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_C}
\end{figure}
Layout C \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_C} employs parallel lanes upstream, which allows agents to form queues before merging into the main corridor, showing better organization than Layout B. However, merging still requires navigating through a turning angle, resulting in a relatively low overall speed limitation. As shown in \ref{fig:corridorwidth}, Layout C exhibits an abnormal fluctuation at 1.6 m width, where evacuation time is actually longer than that of the 1.4 m corridor width. Comparing the speed and trajectory diagrams for 1.4 m and 1.6 m cases, we can observe that in the 1.6 m scenario, although attempts are made to form two lanes in the bottleneck area before the exit and the merging zone below, the centerline distance between the two lanes remains too close. This intuisively results in a great increase in lane width, reflecting more friction and avoidance behavior, which matches the Social Force Model's description. After the width increases to 1.8-2.0 m, the inter-lane spacing and merging diffusion angle increase, the slow-speed zones are eliminated, and evacuation performance rapidly improves. At the width of 2.4 m , the turning angle effect becomes essentially negligible, and the speed limitation exceeded that of Layout A.
\\Among the three layout types, stable low-speed zones most commonly appear at the following locations: intersections or merging areas, sharp turns and convergence sections before exits. Increasing width makes these low-speed zones shorter, shallower and less frequent. This may indicate that corridor width is not a direct contributing factor. Rather than continuing to widen corridors blindly when the corridor width is already relatively wide, it would be better to optimize these low-speed zones, such as extending merging transitions, reducing merge angles and increasing directional guidance and one-way organization.
