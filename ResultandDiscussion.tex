    \label{fig:tet_vs_width}
\end{figure}
The results of this study \ref{fig:tet_vs_width} indicate that the wider the corridor, the shorter the total evacuation time, but the returns from widening do not increase linearly. Within the range of approximately 1.0-1.6/1.8 m, even a slight increase in width can lead to a significant reduction in time; when the width approaches or exceeds 2.0 m, continued widening still provides benefits, but the magnitude is no longer substantial. This aligns with everyday experience: in very crowded spaces, even a small additional passageway can help disperse the flow of people; however, when the space is not particularly crowded to begin with, adding more passageway does not yield such noticeable improvement.

\subsection{Speed and Trajectories Analysis}
Looking at the speed and trajectories of Layout A \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_A},B \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_B},C \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_C}, as the width increased from 1.0m to 1.6-1.8m, the main corridors of the three layouts generally transformed from a crowded zone to two relatively stable parallel lanes. The speed chart shows that the originally continuous red and yellow bands have been replaced by two greener bands, and the slow zone has significantly contracted. This indicates that the increase in width first reduces lateral friction and frequent evasive maneuvering, allowing individuals to maintain a speed close to free-flow for a longer period of time. In terms of the total evacuation time, this stage has the largest reduction, and the result fluctuations of each layout have simultaneously decreased.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{speed_trajectory_layout_A.png}
    \caption{Speed and Trajectories for Layout A}
    \label{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_A}
\end{figure}
\\The main corridor in Layout A is relatively straight, with multiple tributary inflow points along the line. The trajectory and velocity diagrams show that tributaries have already formed orderly queues before reaching the confluence point, with only mild short-distance deceleration when entering the main corridor. This suggests that conflicts are resolved in advance within the tributaries, with stable dual lanes forming starting from corridor widths of 1.6 m, while widths of 2.0-2.4 m maintain only small deceleration zones before the final exit. As a result, medium to high-width sections have lower average times, smaller variances, and higher speed limits. Furthermore, as width increases, evacuation time decreases relatively steadily.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{speed_trajectory_layout_B.png}
    \caption{Speed and Trajectories for Layout B}
    \label{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_B}
\end{figure}
\\Layout B contains multiple T-shaped or cross intersections with dispersed confluence points. Under corridor widths of 1.0-1.4 m, the lower section near intersection points repeatedly experiences team breaking and regrouping phenomena. The visual manifestation in the diagram is the formation of multiple mesh-like low-speed zones, with numerous congestion points covering a wide range. After widening the width to 1.6 and 1.8 m, these mesh-like low-speed zones significantly diminish and form lanes, which indicates that widening the corridor width can effectively avoid interactive conflicts, resulting in the greatest time reduction. However, at 2.4 m, some remaining light yellow zones are still visible, causing the speed limitation at the high-width stage to be slightly lower than layouts A and C.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{speed_trajectory_layout_C.png}
    \caption{Speed and Trajectories for Layout C}
    \label{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_C}
\end{figure}
\\Layout C \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_C} employs parallel lanes upstream, which allows agents to form queues before merging into the main corridor, showing better organization than Layout B. However, merging still requires navigating through a turning angle, resulting in a relatively low overall speed limitation. As shown in \ref{fig:tet_vs_width}, Layout C exhibits an abnormal fluctuation at 1.6 m width, where evacuation time is actually longer than that of the 1.4 m corridor width. Comparing the speed and trajectory diagrams for 1.4 m and 1.6 m cases, we can observe that in the 1.6 m scenario, although attempts are made to form two lanes in the bottleneck area before the exit and the merging zone below, the centerline distance between the two lanes remains too close. This intuisively results in a great increase in lane width, reflecting more friction and avoidance behavior, which matches the Social Force Model's description. After the width increases to 1.8-2.0 m, the inter-lane spacing and merging diffusion angle increase, the slow-speed zones are eliminated, and evacuation performance rapidly improves. At the width of 2.4 m , the turning angle effect becomes essentially negligible, and the speed limitation exceeded that of Layout A.
\\Among the three layout types, stable low-speed zones most commonly appear at the following locations: intersections or merging areas, sharp turns and convergence sections before exits. Increasing width makes these low-speed zones shorter, shallower and less frequent. This may indicate that corridor width is not a direct contributing factor. Rather than continuing to widen corridors blindly when the corridor width is already relatively wide, it would be better to optimize these low-speed zones, such as extending merging transitions, reducing merge angles and increasing directional guidance and one-way organization.

\subsection{Double Exits Comparison}
According to Figure \ref{fig:all_tet_vs_width}, after setting up dual exits, the total evacuation time for all three layouts decreased overall, with significantly reduced fluctuation between trials. The 1.0-1.6/1.8 m range remains the interval with the fastest efficiency improvement; when the width beyond 2.0 m, the marginal benefits of continued widening disappear, and the curve tends to flatten. Compared to single exit, double exits first reduce the low-speed zones in the terminal convergence section, offering the system a stable state with sufficient capacity. Under double exits condition, the speed and trajectories of all three layouts are more uniform and the trend is smooth, with significantly more green sections, while red and yellow low-speed zones are compressed into shorter localized areas. Agents seperate earlier after they start to evacute, and the backtracking and snake-like movement in the main corridor are notably reduced.

\end{figure}
Under single exit condition, Layout A \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_A} can easily form a continuous low-speed zone before the exit. Although relatively stable double lanes have appeared in the middle section, the convergence of lanes at the end still causes significant speed reduction and creates certain fluctuations. When it comes to double exits \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_A2}, the flow distribution shifts the merging points towards both side exits, weakening the low-speed zone and leaving deceleration before merging. The trajectories show almost no congestion or fluctuation, with the main green flow band extending throughout the entire length. The result shows that the Layout A2 maintains low and stable total times across all widths, showing that the double-exit design directly eliminates the terminal bottleneck.

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{speed_trajectory_layout_A2.png}
    \caption{Speed and Trajectories for Layout A2}\label{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_A2}
\end{figure}
\\In single-exit Layout B \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_B}, repeated phenomena of crowd breakup and regrouping occur near multiple intersections, forming a network of red and yellow slow-speed zones on the speed diagram, particularly prominent in the 1.0-1.4 m range. After introducing the second exit \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_B2}, the terminal convergence pressure in Layout B2 was not significantly reduced, with only slight decreases in evacuation time, and even increases in time observed in the condition of 1.2m and 1.4-1.8m corridor width. The reason may be that multiple intersection points are still retained in the upper zone of the area, requiring agents to make multiple detours and reorganizations. The two-sided flow distribution and widened passages cannot effectively alleviate congestion at these local intersection points. Meanwhile, the wider passages may actually make agents' avoidance behavior more pronounced, thereby slowing down evacuation time. This indicates that for geometries with dense intersections, although double exits can alleviate terminal congestion, further reduction of low-speed zones still requires local geometric modification measures.

    \caption{Speed and Trajectories for Layout B2}\label{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_B2}
\end{figure}
\\In single-exit Layout C \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_C}, the parallel chnnels in the upper zone can form orderly queues in advance, but continuous low-speed zones appear at the corner. After setting up double exits \ref{fig:speed_trajectory_layout_C2}, the queues formed in the upper zone can be released directly through the upper-left exit without needing to pass through the corner and merge into the main corridor. This allows the Layout C2 to have the lowest overall evacuation time across all widths. This indicates that the double exits effectively weakened the influence of corner and fully utilized the advantages of parallel channels.
